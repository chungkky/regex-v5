title: Regular Expressions
---
Everyone has at some point run up against the limitations of searching files and manipulating them in bulk.  This becomes a significant problem when you are attempting to integrate data from multiple sources that are inconsistently formatted.  If dates are written 2015/02/18 in one file and 02/18/2015 in another, it would be great if you could make them all 2015-02-18 without changing them all manually.  Regular expressions allow you to set rules to find complicated phrases in files.
